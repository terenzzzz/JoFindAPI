You should Google
The Amero
Then the Afro
Then the Euro
Anything
For that green
It's a scam
It's a scheme

[Hook]
What people do for money
Anything for that green
What people do for money
It's a scam, it's a scheme
What people do for money
Anything for that green

[Intro: protestor]
We're talking about a bailout for some of the wealthiest banks in the world, and yet we can't seem to help our own citizens who are having foreclosure crises--

[Intro: news announcer]
--the bailout on the house floor, warning it could destroy the dollar, and the global economy--

[Intro: legislator]
--working families are suffering, unemployment is over 10% in my own district, we have over 2,300 people who have lost their homes to foreclosure, retirement and pension funds are losing value, local government can't make decisions--

[Verse 1: Stic.man]
For a five dollar bill
Certain parts of the real
You can get your blood spilled
On the concrete
Little 17 year old nigga doing foul in the hood
On the prowl, out in these streets
I've been in the same situation
Heartbeat racing
You come up or you don't eat
I done had to sleep in a train station
Going stop to stop, but no place to be
Paperchasing
Filling out applications for weeks
Just trying to get up on my feet
But they ain't hiring
So a nigga's forced to resort to the streets
Just to make ends meet
It's called survival
The struggle continues
If it offends you
Let me remind you
We all have instincts
To do what we have to do
To make it through
And this drive is primal
Whether you at MickeyD's taking an order
Or coming from Florida transporting a quarter
Or on a corner
We all got needs
I gotta feed my son
He gotta feed his daughter
Naw, I ain't no capitalist-exploiter
But I know the rules of supply and demand
Whoever controls the product
Controls the supply
And, well, hey that's the law of the land
Make your own stimulus plan

[Hook]

[Verse 2: M-1]
People lie
People cheat
People steal
People will
Do anything
For that green
It's a scam
It's a scheme
You should Google
The Amero
Then the Afro
Then the Euro
Dollar bills don't make you royal
It can kill you
It can cure you
Love for money
Root of evil
I say lack of it
That's more accurate
Army, navy, special forces
Rob the land of its resources
Gold, oil, guns, ice
Gas, corn, beans, rice
It's your life
You better think twice
How bad you want that?
Name your price

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stic.man]
Don't ever think slavery was just about race
Slavery was about money
They say the USA was founded on freedom
But slavery built this country
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln
Hamilton, Jackson, Grant
Were all slave-owners
And even today
From Clinton to Bush
They running the same game on us
They so-called war on terror
Is just a ploy to get more cheddar
Dinero, the root of all evil
They come in bombing, shooting, exploit the people
And call it freedom
It's a cold game
And it's the same from the top of the food chain
All the way down to the little homie in the street gangs
Slanging cocaine, it's how they do thangs
It's the American way
Imperialism, have it your way
Whatever it takes
Whoever gets fucked in the process, that's okay
That's how they play
So you can't blame us
Them dead white men on that paper ain't us
We still gotta hustle for the benefits, man
My grind is my stimulus plan...

[Hook]

[Outro: legislator]
And my constituents are concerned about
Where the 700 billion dollars is going
They want to know
Because they get up every morning
They work hard
They give up their tax dollars
And they're trying to figure out
Where did the money go?
Where's it going?

[Hook]`

I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet, but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause inside, we are really made the same
In life, waiting's just a stupid game

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves

[Verse 2]
I'd do anything if you would just believe me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall
If I had a painter's mind, then I would paint it
Or a sculptor's hands, then I would shape it
But instead, I guess I'll sing it in this song

[Pre-Chorus]
I cry more than I ever sang
Each time, your love seems to save the day

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves`

Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, "What now?"
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, "Play my shit"
And they gon' sing like this

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
£2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo)
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded (Gettin' faded)
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

[Verse 3: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Mmm, I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make you seem unfair
St. Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her and Ceiline, oh yeah
She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person, I be low-key, oh yeah
From New York out to London
She was, she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road, so long she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights`

const full_lyric4 = `We purge your words of wisdom
With darkness at our side
Burning down your kingdom
To honour those who died

We never remain silent
When we're ordered to
We'll always be outspoken
In everything we do

With a thousand voices
We cry out our tears
Our solitude and anger
Our hopes and fears

Our open hearts bear wisdom
For everyone to see
To be a guiding light
For those in misery

We will wage this war forever
On each and every battleground
With every word and song
With every move and sound

For a thousand years from now
Our souls will echo on
In your hearts and minds
Although we are gone`
